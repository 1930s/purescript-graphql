# Purescript GraphQL

PureScript GraphQL is a wrapper around [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js). It contains powerful, typed bindings that will make building GraphQL servers as typesafe as possible. Furthermore it automatically translates `Aff`s into promises and `Maybe`s into `null` values where they would be expected by the library.
